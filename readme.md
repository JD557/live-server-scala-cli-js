# An experiment in a dev server for scala JS

Try and break the dependance on node / npm completely whilst retaining a sane developer experience for browser based scala-js development.

## Goals
- Live reload / link on change
- Hot application of style (no page reload)
- Proxy server (TODO)

## Contraints

- Scala cli to build frontend
- ESModule output (only)
- Third party ESModules via import map rather than npm
- Styles through LESS

## Quickstart

```sh

```
